TODO, on the bot side of things:
1. FIX THE DIRECT MESSAGES CRASH. cory can't access roles in DMs because they dont exist, that's probably why it happens.
2. server-specific settings (move incineration rate to here, define roles cory can give out, etc)
3. quarantine incineration to be one but many potential outcomes
4. Petrification: Locked to a specific channel. CORY can petrify users for sending messages in this channel, which gradually increases the slowmode. Each petrification also slows down the rate CORY posts at in the channel.
